        <span>Full stack</span> in technology development refers to an entire
        computer system or application from front end (customer or user-facing)
        to the back end (the "behind-the-scenes" technology such as databases
        and internal architecture) and the software code that connects the two.

        I used to think that you were either a web designer or a web developer.
        Or maybe you were one of those rare unicorns who did both. But either
        way, you either worked on the design of the site, or the code that made
        it work. And then I started seeing all these job listings asking for
        “front end developers” or “back end developers” and even “full stack
        developers.” Um. What the heck is a full stack developer? As the Web has
        grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet,
        developers have gotten more specialized. That means that web development
        now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer
        specializes in. Here are the three main categories:
      </p>
      <li class="fbf">
        <span> front end </span> development (the visible parts of a website or
        app)
      </li>
      <li class="fbf">
        <span> back end </span> development (the “under the hood” databases and
        infrastructure)
      </li>
      <li class="fbf">
        <span> full stack </span> development (a hybrid of both).Full stack can
        apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e.
        software programs for specific devices)
      </li>
      <p class="fullstack-def">
        To understand what each of the web developer specialties (or in the case
        of full stack web developers, non-specialties) are, we’ve created a
        guide breaking them all down, along with the skills you need to learn to
        become a full stack developer—if that’s your thing. Read on for more
        insight into what front end, back end, and full stack developers do (and
        why the lines between them are getting really blurry).
